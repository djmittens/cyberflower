- **Challenge**: Managing state size (10TB+) while maintaining low latency
- **Progress**: 80% complete, currently optimizing state backends for better performance
- **Impact**: Expected to reduce attribution delays from hours to seconds

### Cross-Region Disaster Recovery
**Objective**: Implement active-active Kafka clusters with automatic failover
- **Scope**: Mirror 500+ topics across US-East, US-West, and EU regions
- **Complexity**: Handling exactly-once guarantees during region failovers
- **Timeline**: Pilot testing in staging, production rollout planned for Q4
- **Dependencies**: Network infrastructure upgrades and DNS failover automation

### Stream Schema Evolution Platform
**Objective**: Enable backward/forward compatible schema changes without downtime
- **Features**: Automated compatibility testing, gradual rollout mechanisms
- **Integration**: Deep integration with Schema Registry and CI/CD pipelines  
- **Status**: MVP complete, expanding to support complex nested schema evolution
- **Adoption**: 80% of streaming applications now using managed schema evolution

## Team Expertise & Responsibilities

- **Capacity Planning**: Predictive scaling based on traffic patterns and seasonal trends
- **Performance Tuning**: JVM optimization, serialization improvements, memory management

## Meeting Notes & Technical Discussions

### August 22, 2025 - Architecture Review
**Key Topics Discussed:**
- **Flink 1.18 Upgrade**: New async I/O improvements showing 30% latency reduction
- **Kafka 3.6 Features**: Tiered storage reducing costs by 40% for historical data
- **Cross-region Replication**: MirrorMaker 2.0 vs custom replication solutions evaluation
- **Schema Registry**: Confluent vs in-house schema management cost-benefit analysis

**Technical Decisions Made:**
- Adopt Flink's new adaptive scheduler for better resource utilization
- Implement custom partitioning for geographically distributed consumers
- Standardize on Avro with JSON fallback for schema evolution flexibility

### Performance Optimization Initiatives
**Memory Management**: Reduced GC pressure by 60% through off-heap state backends
**Network Optimization**: Custom serializers improved throughput by 25%
**State Size Reduction**: Incremental cleanup reduced state storage by 50%
**Parallelism Tuning**: Dynamic scaling based on queue depth and processing lag

## Critical Challenges & Solutions

### High-Cardinality State Management
**Challenge**: Flink jobs with billions of keys causing memory pressure and slow checkpoints
**Solution**: Implemented incremental checkpointing with TTL-based state cleanup
**Result**: Reduced checkpoint times from 10 minutes to 30 seconds

### Exactly-Once Semantics at Scale
**Challenge**: Maintaining exactly-once guarantees across complex multi-stage pipelines  
**Solution**: End-to-end idempotency with custom sink connectors and deduplication
**Result**: Zero data loss or duplication across 200+ production streaming jobs

### Schema Evolution Complexity
**Challenge**: Breaking changes in upstream systems causing downstream failures
**Solution**: Schema compatibility testing in CI/CD with gradual rollout mechanisms
