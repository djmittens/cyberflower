# Delta Forge - Lakehouse Platform Team

Delta Forge is the specialized team responsible for building and maintaining our modern lakehouse architecture. We enable self-service analytics across the organization while ensuring data quality, governance, and performance at petabyte scale.

## Platform Overview

### Lakehouse Architecture
- **Multi-Engine Support**: Spark, Presto, Trino for different workload types
- **ACID Transactions**: Full Delta Lake implementation with merge, update, delete operations
- **Time Travel**: Historical data access and audit trails for compliance
- **Schema Evolution**: Automatic schema management with backward compatibility

### Data Quality Framework
- **Automated Testing**: 500+ data quality checks running on every batch
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-powered detection of data distribution shifts
- **Lineage Tracking**: End-to-end data flow visualization and impact analysis
- **SLA Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for data freshness and quality violations

## Current Projects

### Q3 2025 Major Initiatives

#### Project Temporal
Complete implementation of time travel APIs across all business-critical datasets
- **Scope**: 200+ tables with historical access requirements
- **Progress**: 75% complete, remaining complex nested schema tables
- **Challenge**: Performance optimization for queries spanning months of history
- **Timeline**: Target completion October 1, 2025

#### Schema Registry v2.0
Next-generation schema management with automated evolution
- **Features**: Backward/forward compatibility checks, schema validation pipelines
- **Integration**: Kafka Connect, Delta Lake, streaming applications
- **Status**: Design phase complete, implementation 30% done
- **Dependencies**: Confluent Schema Registry licensing decision

#### Data Mesh Implementation
Decentralized data ownership with centralized governance
- **Domains**: 8 business domains identified, 3 already onboarded
- **Governance**: Automated policy enforcement and compliance checking
- **Self-Service**: Domain teams can deploy data products independently
- **Metrics**: Reduced data request fulfillment from 2 weeks to 2 days

### Infrastructure Improvements

#### Performance Optimization
