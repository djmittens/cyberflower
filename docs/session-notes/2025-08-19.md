# Session Notes — 2025-08-19

## Summary
- Built a static, frontend-only Cyberpunk 2077–styled CRM.
- Markdown-driven content compiled to JSON via `scripts/build.mjs`.
- Unified catalog: external customers + internal teams (treated as customers).
- Implemented neon SPA with search, facets (Type/Frameworks/Services/Tags), sorting, cards, and a polished, scrollable detail modal.

## Repo Quick Start
- Build: `make build`
- Run: `make run` then open http://localhost:5173
- Authoring:
  - External customers: `content/customers/*.md`
  - Internal teams (our customers): `content/teams/*.md`
  - Template and field docs: `docs/content-authoring.md`

## Key Decisions
- Frontmatter is JSON (not YAML) for a dependency-free builder.
- Internal teams normalized to unified customers with `customer_type: "internal-team"`.
- Cards show essential info only (name, type, 2–3 frameworks, owner/members, updated/prio).
- Detail modal: sticky header, visual summaries (FR/Issues bars, asks timeline), scrollable body.

## What’s Implemented
- Build outputs:
  - `public/data/customers.json` (unified)
  - `public/data/customers.external.json`, `public/data/teams.json` (debug/reference)
- UI/UX:
  - Cyberpunk palette, clipped corners, hazard stripe, glitch branding.
  - Faceted search; sort by name/updated/priority.
  - Redesigned cards with hover animation and full-card click.
  - Modal open/close animations; overlay click + Esc to close; body scroll lock.

## Content Present Today
- Customers: ACME Co., OmniTek Systems
- Teams (internal customers): 10 (Neon Core, Edge Stream, Delta Forge, CDC Rangers, Model Makers, Ops Squad, Quality Lab, Platform X, Realtime Unit, Afterburn ML)
- Avatars: SVG placeholders in `src/assets/avatars/`

## Known Items / Follow-ups
- Accessibility (P1):
  - Add ARIA roles/labels to modal and buttons; implement focus trap and return focus to opener.
  - Ensure contrast and keyboard navigation for cards and close button.
- Filtering (P1):
  - Add facets for Libraries (from teams) and date-range quick filters (e.g., next meeting in 7/30 days).
- Roadmap View (P2):
  - Aggregate Asks + Feature Requests into a timeline/kanban with filters by priority/status/owner.
- Export/Print (P2):
  - Print-friendly stylesheet for a single record; optional PDF export.
- Data Hygiene (P2):
  - Optional schema validation step for frontmatter (simple JSON schema in builder).
- Visual Polish (P2):
  - Optional glitch ripple transition on modal open; density toggle (comfortable/compact).

## Nice-to-Haves
- CSV import/export for bulk updates.
- Persistent UI state (query/facets) via URL or localStorage.
- Offline fonts bundling to avoid external calls.

## Quick Verification Checklist (Tomorrow)
- Run `make build && make run` and test:
  - Cards hover/animation and click-through.
  - Modal scroll on long team (e.g., Edge Stream); close via X, overlay, and Esc.
  - Search across frameworks, services, tags, members, libraries, notes.
  - Type facet toggling internal vs external; sorting behavior.

## Notes for Authors
- Teams are internal customers; include:
  - `members[]` (name, role, optional email), `libraries[]` (name, project), `meeting_dates[]`, `asks[]` (ask, due, status)
  - Use Markdown body for meeting notes; fenced code supported.
