# Session Notes — 2025-08-20 (Session 2)

## Summary
- Upgraded the global search into a command-style action bar with suggestions, keyboard navigation, and neon HUD styling.
- Standardized the UI by removing the external vs internal-team distinction; unified content, filters, and displays.
- Consolidated content into a single folder and simplified the build to a single records loader.
- Ensured every record has an avatar; added bespoke SVG avatars for ACME Co. and OmniTek.

## Key Changes
- Action bar: suggestion panel, arrow/enter support, Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut, kbd hint, built-in search icon, seam, clipped corners, and focus glow.
- Removed type chips and type-based suggestions; filtering now focuses on frameworks/services/tags + sort.
- Cards/detail: no type pill; show Members/Libraries/Asks when data exists (not by type).
- Filesystem: moved all Markdown from `content/teams/` into `content/customers/`.
- Build script: replaced dual loaders with `loadRecords()` (reads `content/customers/`); derives frameworks from libraries and owner from members.
- Avatars: per-id fallback (`assets/avatars/<id>.svg`), default template if missing; new `acme-co.svg` and `omnitek.svg` added.
- Docs: updated authoring guide and prior session notes to reflect unification and avatar behavior.

## Files Touched (high level)
- `src/index.html`: Action bar markup; removed type chips.
- `src/styles/hud.css`: Action bar visuals, clipped corners, panel styles; cleaned unused type-chip styles.
- `src/styles.css`: Removed type pill styles.
- `src/app.js`: Command palette logic; removed type facet/state and UI; conditional sections by data presence; minor copy.
- `scripts/build.mjs`: Unified loader `loadRecords()`; avatar resolution; removed split outputs.
- `content/`: moved `teams/*` into `customers/*`.
- `src/assets/avatars/`: added `acme-co.svg`, `omnitek.svg`.
- `docs/`: updated authoring + session notes; added this session.

## Verification
- Build and run: `make build && make run` → open http://localhost:5173
- Action bar: Ctrl/Cmd+K opens; type to see facet suggestions; navigate with ↑/↓, Enter to apply; Esc closes.
- UI: No type chips; search bar shows clipped corner and visible border; focus glow present.
- Data: ACME Co. and OmniTek show custom avatars; members/libraries/asks appear when present; sorting works.

## Follow-ups
- Add icons per suggestion kind and more prefixes (framework/service/tag:).
- Optional: subtle banner divider and animated scanline on search focus.
- Mobile polish: small-screen spacing for action bar and panel.
